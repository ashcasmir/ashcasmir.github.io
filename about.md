Hey, this is Ashwin. As the site description reads, I am an noob programmer, an amateur writer and a life-long learner. This is my 123151 attempt at writing online (...I may tend to exaggerate, for effect).

I've moved away from usual choice of blogging platforms to "Jekyll" since it's free to host, with my domain name (thanks to Github pages), and gets the job done. I've run into a few snags before I was able to get this up online.
This blog is going to be the place where I will be learning in public. Writing about what I'm going through while I'm learning something new.

Find below the non-exhaustive list of the things that I'm currently learning.

1. Zettlekasten and taking smart notes
2. Touch typing using DVORAK 
3. Jekyll and Github
4. The Odin Project
5. Task Management



A disclaimer: Although, I'm writing in public, I'm writing more for myself than for those who read my blog. This blog is an experiment where I want to increase my accountability and build the writing habit by writing and thus learning in public.
