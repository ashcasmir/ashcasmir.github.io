Keep staring at the black cross at the center of the image, and after a point the colored balls seem to slowly disappear. So when the brain keeps seeing the same input from it's peripheral vision, after a point of time it discards this information since it interprets the information is irrelevant. This is called 'habituation'. The brain does this to remain efficient, since it can redirect resources to other places where more focus is required. 

Now, this is similar to how we see the world. When we are seeing something repeatedly, we have fixed perspective of how we see it. And most often we no longer pay too much attention to it. And the best minds have come up with world changing ideas, by seeing the world around them differently.

So don't search for the extraordinary, look at the things that are right in front of us, but only this time from the perspective that escapes most people.
