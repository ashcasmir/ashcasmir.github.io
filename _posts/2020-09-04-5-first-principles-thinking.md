I have heard about this mental model multiple times, especially in relation to Elon Musk, however I have not looked into what it actually meant.

To the uninitiated, *it means breakdown an idea to the fundamental truths behind the idea (or first principles), and reconstruct a new idea using these building blocks. *

By nature human mind uses analogy to understand ideas, and then when we brainstorm, we use the analogy to think laterally. This limits our creativity and problem solving ability. Whereas when we use first principle thinking, we go to the source to understand the rules, and then we can build ideas with the actual rules of the games, and not those imposed by other players.
