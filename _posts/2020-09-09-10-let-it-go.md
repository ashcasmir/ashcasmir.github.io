It's simple to diffuse most high stress situation,  if I'm just willing to let go of my ego. 

It's simple but not easy. Since, I'm working against my mind, which feels that being defensive against any threat is the best way to keep me alive. 

So, the first step is assure that your limbic brain is aware that there is no real threat to me and I can stop getting all tensed up and defensive. 

Once I start to relax, and the pre-frontal cortex begins to take over, accept the situation, before you take a decision on your next action.

TL;DR - When faced with a high tension situation

1. Repeat the words to yourself, "I'm not going to die from this".


2. Just "let it go!"
