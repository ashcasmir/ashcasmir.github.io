> A lot of success in life is that passion and persistence, of really staying the course, staying working on it, and, not letting go. Not giving up. - Dr. Terrence Sejnowski

People tend to attribute success to talent, luck and opportunity, and discount the role of hard-work and persistence. I have been used to this style of thinking. This style of thinking absolves me from taking action. Since it's easier than doing the work.

This reminds me of 'Rock Lee' from the manga, Naruto. He's the guy who had been shunned by the community for having no talent for ninjutsu (ninja magic). And he overcomes this limitation with sheer will and his relentless work ethic.

The only advantage that talent provides, is a little head-start, which means it would take a few more hours/days for the non-talented, persistent person to get there.
