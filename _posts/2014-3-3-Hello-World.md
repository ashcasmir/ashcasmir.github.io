After a long time, I'm back to publishing on the web. I had tried blogging from multiple platforms, but my experimentations were usually short-lived, with most spanning just a week. My longest writing streak was in December 2018, where I had written about 20+ posts within a 30-day period. This was after I had started writing, being inspired by [this Seth Godin's post](https://seths.blog/2018/10/the-first-1000-are-the-most-difficult/).

However, I had taken a long hiatus since then. Recently after discovering Zettlekasten and Obsidian, my writing output has increased. I have been highlighting and capturing my thoughts on most of the things I read. And after coming across [Andy's Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/), I wanted to start my own blog, again.

About a month ago I came across this [blog post](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/start-a-blog) from Nat Eliason on how to start a blog that changes your life.

A couple of weeks ago, I came across this on Twitter.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Many people assume they are bad at writing because it is hard. This is like assuming you are bad at weightlifting because the weight is heavy.<br><br>Writing is useful because it is hard. It&#39;s the effort that goes into writing a clear sentence that leads to better thinking.</p>&mdash; James Clear (@JamesClear) <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1289976285028954113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And just last week, a video from one of my favourite YouTubers, reiterating the point about writing everyday.

It feels like the Universe was trying to incept the idea to start blogging again. And here we are...

Today morning, I started with a quick tutorial on how to create a Jekyll-powered blog hosted on Github pages. And after about an hour and a half, I was all done and about to publish my first blog post.

*This is going to be the place where I intend to share my thoughts everyday, in the form of a short post.* 

Currently I'm still retaining the github pages url. I'll be migrating to a more permanent domain name, soon.
