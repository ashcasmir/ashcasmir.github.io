> I think that the fact that children are not so much perfectionist like adults tend to be, children are okay with making mistakes. They kind of stumble and fall and we, we help them along and they play games in the language and they live the language - Benny Lewis, Fluent in 3 Months

I have never actually put a lot of thought into this, but I now realize how true this statement is. While children are having fun learning things, I am too focused on getting things 'just' right. I'm too scared to make mistakes, constantly worrying what others would think of my effort. However, kids don't care about any of this. They continue to take effort in communicating their thoughts, without a care about what others may think.

_Wondering what others would think_ is the main reason why I'm not showing my work more, whether it's playing the guitar, blogging, or speaking in French. It's much safer doing all this in private, until I reach a "perfect" level. However, this removes a lot of the learning, which happens through feedback!

What is the worst that could happen? People can make fun of me learning something new! Which isn't all that bad in the first place, and most people just don't care. It's mostly the mental barriers that I had built up in my mind that is preventing me from doing & learning.
