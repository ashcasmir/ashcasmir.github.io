> You come to understand that most people are neither for you nor against you, they are thinking about themselves. You learn that no matter how hard you try to please, some people in this world are not going to love you, a lesson that is at first troubling and then really quite relaxing. - Personal Renewal, John Gardener

I am a people pleaser by nature, and this is something that I need to remind myself often. This will allow me to forgive others, when I realise that their actions are in their self-interest and not done just to spite me.

And more than that, it allows me to be more self-compassionate, and  accept the idea that there are going to be people who hate me, regardless of my actions and intentions towards them, and that is okay. Understanding that it's not my job to make everyone like me, will make my life easier and focus on working on my own happiness.
