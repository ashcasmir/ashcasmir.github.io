> If you go even further and set it in mind that you want to dream about the material it seems to improve your chances of dreaming about it, still further. - Barbara Oakley

So for a little context, here Ms. Oakley speaks about the diffused mode of thinking, is the learning mode that allows you to build wild connections in your brain, and this helps you learn better. So when we give an intention that we want to dream about something, you learn even when you sleep. 

And this is something that is a part of Josh Waitzkin's journaling process. (from the [Tim Ferriss Show podcast - How to Cram 2 Months of Learning in 1 Day](https://tim.blog/2019/07/03/the-tim-ferriss-show-transcripts-josh-waitzkin-how-to-cram-2-months-of-learning-into-1-day-375/))

> **Josh Waitzkin:** They can feel it. In my diagnostic process, I find pretty consistently people are right. I ask people to rate one through 10 how their energy levels and creative state is in different parts of the day. And then of course, I examine it. But people tend to have a pretty good sense for this. I think it’s really important. One of the things that I have every one do — and that I’ve been doing my whole life — is ending my day thinking about the most important question in what I do. Then waking up in the morning, first thing, pre-input, and brainstorming on it.

Intentionally creating a learning intention at the end of the day, and following it with a writing window for the next day. Certainly something worth exploring and what Edison would agree too.
