There are different ways in which people learn.

## Learning by acquiring knowledge from others

This is where you learn from reading, listening or seeing how other people have dealt with your situation. This allows you to gain knowledge across a variety of fields. This is usually the starting point of learning. For most cases, this is how you learn, and this is perhaps the easiest form of learning.

## Learning by doing

This is a much more effective form of learning than the previous one. This is where you take the initial knowledge, and put it into practice. This forces you to be more active in your learning, and thus allowing for better retention. This is the reason that most crafts involving a high degree of skills require this type of learning.

## Learning by osmosis

I am a big believer of learning by just being around smart people. I have experienced that I have acquired skills and rapidly expanded my knowledge, just by working with the right set of people, who are highly knowledgeable. This type of learning is slow & gradual and usually hard to notice, especially when the learning happens within the environment. So usually, you notice the difference only when you look back, reviewing your progress.

Learning by osmosis, also incites you to learn through the other methods, to allow you to keep working with these smart people.
