> If there were a drug that could do for human health everything that exercise can, it would likely be the most valuable pharmaceutical ever developed. - Dr. Mark Tarnapolsky, [The New Science of Exercise](https://hyp.is/jz002vYoEeqMvX9MeQYeIQ/time.com/magazine/us/4475598/september-12th-2016-vol-188-no-10-u-s/)

Universally, everyone agrees to the benefits of exercise on our body. It improves cardio vascular functions, aids bone & muscle development, and even improves skin health.

However, the positive effects to the brain are not as much explored. And unfortuately, I come in the "academic professors" category, where I give priority to the mind over our body, and as [Ken Robinson eloquently put it,](https://www.ted.com/talks/sir_ken_robinson_do_schools_kill_creativity?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare) I often feel that 'our bodies are for getting our brains to meetings'.  

And when I came across all the [positive effects of exercise on the brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsVzKCk066g), I was shocked and kind of pissed with myself for shirking off exercise for so long. 

And with my recent investment into a fitness watch, I definitely want to move more!
