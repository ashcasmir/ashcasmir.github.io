> I found that there isn't, a simple way to keep yourself attending something that you're not interested in. But I have found a little trick to waylay the, the speaker, and that is by asking a question. - Dr. Terrence Sejnowski

Most of the meetings that I go to, there is very little that I contribute to the discussion. And I end up not actively paying attention to what's happening.

Usually this flow into meetings where I am expected to contribute. I am generally in a phased out, fiddling with my phone, answering emails, doing tasks (usually not related to the meeting). And some times I'm still trying to formulate my own thoughts and thus not listening to what is being said by others in the meetings.

Although there is something to be said about only \[\[! attending meetings that I can contribute to\]\], I'm just talking about making meetings more productive for all the people involved. And a few simple changes that I want to implement immediately.

## Take active notes:

Write down the important points of the meeting **in your words** in a notepad. This aids better understanding, since it forces you to notice the gaps in your understanding.

## Ask more questions

Whenever you feel that you have not understood what the speaker has said, ask questions to help your understanding. **Don't be afraid of sounding stupid**, it's better to sound stupid now and have a much clearer understanding of the meeting, than the alternative. And there is a good chance that there is at least another person in the meeting, who had the same question and didn't ask.

## Don't get stuck in a question

Once you have a question that you would like to ask, it's important to capture it and move on. If the speaker allows interruption in the middle for questions, then ask immediately. Else, make a note and ask when you get the chance. This will allow you to **free up your mind space** better than losing attention in the meeting, allowing the question to ruminate.
